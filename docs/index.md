This is a collection of free (as in beer) Java code I've developed over the years. 

Try downloading the [demo app](https://github.com/mickleness/pumpernickel/raw/master/release/jars/Pumpernickel.jar) to get started.

## Description ##

Here are screenshots of the demo app:

The topics addressed in this codebase vary (greatly), but common themes include:
*   Desktop Applications
*   User Experience
*   Swing Components
*   Image Processing
*   Performance Optimizations
*   Data Structures

The topics I tackle generally complement either work-related projects or personal (unpublished) projects.

## History ##

One in three adult Americans started a blog between 2005 and 2012. That's a statistic I just made up, but it sounds kinda believable, doesn't it? Remember how big blogs were?

I used to run a blog. Some of those blog articles are still available at [javagraphics.blogspot.com](https://javagraphics.blogspot.com/). (I don't mean to brag, but some of the screenshots even still work! The applets won't, though.) Those articles were write-ups to the accompanying codebase hosted at a (now defunct) java.net repo.

Most of that codebase was migrated to this (the Pumpernickel) project, and instead of offering dozens of stand-alone demos I'm trying to consolidate everything into one demo app that showcases all the best bits.

For a year or two I tried to organize this project into sub-projects with separate Maven artifact IDs, but as of 2019 I'm migrating back to one flat project structure.

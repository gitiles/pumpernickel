<table border="0" cellspacing="0px" cellpadding="0px" padding="0px" width="700px"><tr><td><p>The <b>Pumpernickel</b> project is a library of open-source code covering a wide range of topics.
I'd love to tell you that there's a singular purpose or mission statement driving everything in this
project, but the reality is: this is a collection of classes and tools that I've worked on over the years for
a variety of projects and needs.
<p>Please feel free to browse the <a href="https://mickleness.github.io/pumpernickel/javadoc/">javadoc</a> and the 
<a href="https://github.com/mickleness/pumpernickel">repository</a> and to <a href="mailto:mickleness@gmail.com">email me</a> directly with feedback or suggestions.
<p>Everything in the <code>com.pump</code> codebase is released here under a MIT license.
<p>If you want a quick jump start into some of the code covered here, download the latest
<a href="https://github.com/mickleness/pumpernickel/tree/master/pump-release/com/pump/pump-showcase">showcase</a> jar
and open it. This includes some of the obvious splashy stuff like color dialogs and multithumb sliders, but it also
includes some performance tests that present alternatives to certain <code>ImageIO</code> functions or <code>java.awt.geom.Area</code> performance problems.
<h4>Highlights</h4>

<title>Scaling Demo</title>

<body>
This demo explores a few different models to scaling. The measurements collected show the time/memory required to scale a 2750x2063 image to a 80x60 thumbnail three times. (Ten sample measurements are collected, and only the median is reported.) 
<p>
The clear winner performance-wise here is simply to use an AffineTransform. It's fast. It uses very little memory. There's just one problem: it's ugly. Look at the thumbnails on the bottom of the demo: the transform-based thumbnail looks pixelated -- like it's un-antialiased.
<p>
Romain Guy described the problem: bilinear interpolation starts to fall apart when the scaling factor is less than 50%. (Which is often the case when you're creating thumbnails.) But at 50% it still looks good. In this example we're scaling to about 3%, so it looks pretty ragged.
<p>
Guy also proposed a solution: repeatedly scale the image by up to 50% until we reach our target size. So in this case where we're targeting 3%: we'd scale it once to 50%, then take 50% of that (25%), then 50% again (12.5%), etc. This was written up in his <code>GraphicsUtilities</code> class, which was released under a LGPL license as part of his <a href="http://filthyrichclients.org/">Filthy Rich Clients</a> book. The downside to this approach is: it's the most expensive memory-wise.
<p>
Another possible approach is to use <code>java.awt.Image.getScaledInstance(..)</code>. This is built-in to all <code>Images</code>. The downside to this approach is: it's several times slower than all other options.
<p>
The <code>com.pump.image.pixel.Scaling</code> class is my proposed alternative. This uses the <code>PixelIterator</code> architecture. This may also be the only solution here that can scale an image as it is initially being read. (So we'd never load the megapixel image into memory at all: we only ever load the thumbnail.)

<body>
This demo presents dozens of Transition2D objects that can create a slideshow transition from one image to another.
<p>
All of these transitions use a simple set of <code>Transition2DInstruction</code> objects to describe how each frame is rendered. There are two types of instructions: one for images, and one for shapes. This means we could express a slideshow as a series of rendering instructions (transform here, clip there, outline there, etc). In an early implementation we included a simple optimized SWF export option, but we haven't touched that in years.
<p>
(If anyone wanted to try to help me develop an HTML5 implementation: I may be interested in that. But not <em>so</em> interested that I'm going to do it just for fun without a real life use case...)

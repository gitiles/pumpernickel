<title>JPopover Demo</title>

<body>
I recommend looking over (and reading up on) the <a href="resource:tooltip">tooltip</a> demo before exploring this.
<p>
The <code>JPopover</code> is a new class intended to be a more modern remake of the classic <code>JToolTip</code>. It borrows from Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/macos/human-interface-guidelines/windows-and-views/popovers/">popover</a> and Microsoft's <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742400(v=vs.85).aspx">balloon</a> components.
<p>
My goal was to create a tooltip-like component that:
<ul><li>Is also visible when the owner component has keyboard focus.
<li>Can contain components the user interacts with (buttons, text fields, etc.)</ul>
<p><code>JToolTips</code> are managed by a global <code>ToolTipManager</code>. By contrast each <code>JPopover</code> is in charge of when it should appear and disappear. The default implementation is to show a popover when the owner has either mouse rollover or keyboard focus, but you can override that as needed. Only one popover is showing at a time, though. So if you roll the mouse over one text field and shift keyboard focus to another: the most recent event wins.
<p>
In the password demo be sure to press the caps lock key. This is far from a pixel-perfect replica of Windows's default balloon, but it's a great start. Also you can see as you type (if the caps lock is off) a password-strength meter changes its feedback with every keystroke.
<p>
The font demo is pretty self-explanatory. This is basically a tooltip that follows different visibility rules.
<p>
The currency demo is the only case where the user is expected to interact with the contents of the popover. Observe that for the other two: if the owner doesn't have keyboard focus and you move the mouse from the owner to the popover, then the popover disappears. The currency popover consults both the popover's owner and its contents. (This is controlled with a boolean passed into the JPopover constructor.)

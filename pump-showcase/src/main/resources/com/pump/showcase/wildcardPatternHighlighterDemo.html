<title>Highlighters, WildcardPattern Demo</title>
</head>
<body>

This demo features distinct classes:
<ul><li>The <code>com.pump.text.UnderlineHighlightPainter</code> class is a <code>javax.swing.text.Highlighter</code> class that, well, underlines text. Our original use for this was to highlight misspelled words or syntax errors.
<li>The <code>com.pump.text.TextBoxHighlightPainter</code> is a fun one. This uses the <code>com.pump.awt.TextBlock</code> class to render a big in-your-face highlight.
<li>The <code>com.pump.text.WildcardPattern</code> class is by the far the most interesting class in this demo, but it's a behind-the-scenes util class. It implements a wildcard expression as defined <a href="http://www.linfo.org/wildcard.html">here</a>. Basically this is intended to be simpler/leaner than than a regex pattern: you can use *'s, ?'s and square brackets.</ul>

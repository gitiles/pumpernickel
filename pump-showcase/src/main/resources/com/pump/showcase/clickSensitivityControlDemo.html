This addresses a problem we saw creep up on our users over the years as touchscreens and tablets became more popular.
<p>
The <code>java.awt.event.MouseListener</code> is notified for (among other things) MOUSE_PRESSED, MOUSE_RELEASED and MOUSE_CLICKED events. The first two always work great. But MOUSE_CLICKED events are only triggered after a MOUSE_PRESSED and MOUSE_RELEASED event occur at the same (x,y) location.
<p>
Requiring all events happen at the same (x,y) has become a problem, though. In the same way that we need <a href="resource:mousesmoothing">MouseSmoothing</a> to smooth out the natural tremors in our hand movements, we need to allow for the possibility that users may move the cursor a few pixels and still be trying to "click" something. This relates to both new(ish) technologies for cursor control (such as touchscreens) and to accessibility (such as hand tremors).
<p>
The <code>ClickSensitivityControl</code> class provides a static <code>install()</code> method that creates a universal event listener that identifies and compensates for this issue.
<p>
In this demo you can see this in action when you interact with "Widget B". By contrast "Widget A" explicitly disables the <code>ClickSensitivityControl</code>, so the events it receives are the default events the JVM normally creates.
<p>
As an aside: it's worth noting that <code>AbstractButtons</code> do <em>not</em> rely on MOUSE_CLICKED events. They have their own complex interaction model involving arming buttons. The <code>ClickSensitivityControl</code> only affects logic listening for MOUSE_CLICKED events, such as the <code>BasicTreeUI</code>.
<p>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
The <code>ClickSensitivityControl</code> adds a <code>AWTEventListener</code> for <code>MouseEvents</code>. When a MOUSE_PRESSED, MOUSE_DRAGGED or MOUSE_RELEASED event comes in it is logged. Then we wait a beat (using <code>invokeLater(..)</code> and see if a corresponding MOUSE_CLICKED event comes in. If it does not, then we generate our own MOUSE_CLICKED event and post it to the event queue.
<p>
This implementation should safely handle the possibility that some other entity may also try to "fix" (or at least change) this going forward. If something else generates the MOUSE_CLICKED event: great! If not: we're ready to do it ourselves.
<p>
At any point if the user triggers a MOUSE_DRAGGED event that strays too far from the MOUSE_PRESSED location then the deal's off: the <code>ClickSensitivityControl</code> will never generate a MOUSE_CLICKED event. (To test this: set the click tolerance to 10 pixels, then click "Widget B", move the mouse 20 pixels, then move the mouse back to your starting point: you shouldn't see a MOUSE_CLICKED event.)

Call it an <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/accordions-complex-content/">accordion</a>, call it a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/buttons/disclosure-controls/">disclosure control</a>, or call it <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742409(v=vs.85).aspx">progressive</a>. It's a great alternative to tabs when you have too many UI controls to squeeze into your available real estate.
<p>
The <code>CollapsibleContainer</code> helps set up a series of labeled sections. Through client properties you can control whether a section is collapsible, and/or what vertical weight a section should have in the layout.
<p>
Scrollpanes preserve their existing rectangular border. Trees and lists are given a single-pixel rectangular border. Everything else is put inside a <a href="resource:QPanelUI">box UI</a> to group controls together.

<title>BoxTabbedPaneUI Demo</title>
</head>
<body>

This features a new <code>TabbedPaneUI</code> that resembles Safari's browser tabs.
<p>
I recommend using the default tab UI  <em>if</em> you have a fix number of tabs, and you're confident that 95% of the time they're going to be displayed in one row. For example: if you're designed a dialog box and you have a predefined number of tabs ("Login Options", "Desktop Options", "Security", etc.).
<p>
But if you have a user-defined (unknown) number of tabs: that's where a tab UI like this helps. This is intended to be used for a tabbed documented interface ("TBI", or "MDI" for "Multiple Document Interface").
<h3>Context</h3>
There is a lot of related reading on this online and in well-researched books like <em>About Face</em>. To sum up what I've read so far:
 <ul>
 <li>MDIs were most popular in the 90s and early 2000s. This is partly because of resource limitations at the time -- there was no alternative. Some UX designers regard them with a stigma and will suggest SDIs are the better way to go.
 <li>Still TDIs don't appear to be going away anytime soon. Browsers are the most obvious example. Microsoft Excel is another. Apple, who is notorious for UX scrutiny, recently added tabs to Finder windows. But my favorite example is Notepad vs Notepad++. Notepad is a fine tool, and maybe it's the go-to choice for many users, but Notepad++ (or a similar TDI tool like Atom) is where power-users gravitate to.
</ul>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately I wasn't able to extend the <code>BasicTabbedPaneUI</code> class. (It's always best to extend the basic class if you can! They handle so many small details its easy to forget.) So this is a built-from-scratch implementation. This does not support the tab layout policy attribute: you get one row of tabs and nothing else.
<p>
The row of tabs is displayed using a <code><a href="resource:splayedlayout">SplayedLayout</a></code>, which means several tabs may be squished together but if you mouse over a tab it regains its preferred size.
<p>
This demo features a close button for the tabs, but you have complete control over the tab as a JComponent. For example: you could use a text field to let the user change the document name. You could add a <a href="resource:throbber">throbber</a> or a <a href="resource:circularprogressbarui">CircularProgressBarUI slider</a> to indicate a document is loading. These days browsers may add a sound icon if a tab is playing audio. As I write this in Eclipse I notice my tabs also have a file icon which varies depending on the file type of the tab. Tabs have come a long way since Swing was first conceived; a good UI might find some additional features/feedback to add to its tabs.
<p>
The javadoc describes several client properties you can use to inject control over how components are configured. (For example: you could change the background color, the border, etc.).

The <code>JBreadCrumb</code> and the <code>BreadCrumbUI</code> present a series of <code>JLabels</code> separated by <code>Icons</code>.
<p>
The <code>JBreadCrumb</code> itself is parameterized, so you can create a <code>JBreadCrumb&lt;File&gt;</code>, <code>JBreadCrumb&lt;String&gt;</code>, or whatever your heart desires. Each node/element is passed through a <code>BreadCrumbFormatter</code>, which resembles:
<p>
<pre>public static interface BreadCrumbFormatter&lt;T&gt; {
	public void format(JBreadCrumb<T> container, JLabel label, T pathNode,
			int index);
}</pre>
<p>
Someday I might change this so it relies on <code>AbstractButtons</code> instead of <code>JLabels</code>, but until I have a compelling use case the current implementation is sufficient. Using buttons would let me tap into more well-developed models for interacting with nodes, though. Currently you can add <code>NavigationListeners</code>, which are a custom listener resembling:
<p>
<pre>
public interface NavigationListener<T> {

	public enum ListSelectionType {
		SINGLE_CLICK, DOUBLE_CLICK, KEY
	};

	public boolean elementsSelected(ListSelectionType type, T... elements);
}</pre>
<p>
This is not currently designed to interact with <code>AccessibleContexts</code>. So although the labels will be picked up naturally by any assistive technology, if you've added <code>NavigationListeneres</code> to interact with those labels those won't interface with assistive technology.
<p>
Between each label an icon is rendered, although this icon isn't attached to any <code>JComponent</code>.
<p>
The other key ingredient that gives this component its mojo is the <code>SplayedLayout</code>. In this case this acts like <code>FlowLayout</code>, except it knows which components to squeeze when there isn't enough width to give everything it's preferred dimensions. That means if some labels are squished, you can mouse over each label to fully see it. (You can also see the <code>SplayedLayout</code> at work in the <a href="resource:BoxTabbedPaneUI">BoxTabbedPaneUI</a>.)

There's a lot of UX people waxing philosophical about bread crumbs in general. Here are a couple of articles that I found interesting:

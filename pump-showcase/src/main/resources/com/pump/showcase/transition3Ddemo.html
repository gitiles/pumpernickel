<title>Transition23 Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
This demo presents a pair of common 3D transitions.
<p>
These use the <code>ImageContext</code> to render an image using four transform points. (By contrast: the standard <code>AffineTransform</code> class only lets you use three transform points.)
<p>
Unlike the Transition2D classes: there is not a unifying architecture supporting the 3D-style transitions.

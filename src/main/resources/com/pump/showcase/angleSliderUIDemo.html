<title>AngleSliderUI Demo</title>
</head>
<body>

Once upon a time we needed a widget to edit angles. Technically the <code>javax.swing.JSlider</code> had all the data we needed (a value that had a minimum and maximum), but using a traditional slider to manage an angle was unintuitive.
<p>
The <code>AngleSliderUI</code> is a new <code>SliderUI</code> that renders the value of slider degrees on a circular dial. This was inspired by a widget we saw in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWeb">iWeb</a> Back in those days Aqua <a href="https://512pixels.net/2014/04/aqua-past-future/">still had elements that appeared to resemble candy</a> (bubbly, plastic, shiny). Nowadays both Apple and Microsoft are trending more towards a minimalist design, though.
<p>
In this app you can see an example of this UI in the <a href="resource:Strokes">Strokes, MouseSmoothing</a> demo. Originally we used it to edit drop shadows in an image editor.

The <code>com.pump.swing.JColorPicker</code> and the <code>com.pump.swing.JColorPickerDialog</code> are an alternative to Swing's default <code>javax.swing.JColorChooser</code>.
<p>
As a reminder, the <code>JColorChooser</code> resembles:
<br /><img src="https://github.com/mickleness/pumpernickel/raw/master/resources/jcolorchooser-600.jpg"/>
<p>
Technically you could convert the <code>JColorPicker</code> to a <code>AbstractColorChooserPanel</code> so it can live inside a <code>JColorChooser</code>, but to date nobody has suggested/requested that.
<p>
The key differences between this new <code>JColorPicker</code> and the old-school <code>JColorChooser</code> are probably:
<ul><li>The <code>JColorPicker</code> uses a wheel to display a range of hues, not a square. A square obviously maximizes your pixel real estate better, but I still prefer a circle. I like how it looks, and it's generally how children are introduced to hues in school.
<li>The dialog footer uses a <a href="resource:DialogFooter">DialogFooter</a>, which (among other things) means the buttons are right-aligned like most other dialogs.
<li>As the demo shows the <code>JColorPicker</code> scales in complexity well.</ul>
<p>
That being said: the <code>JColorChooser</code> offers something this panel doesn't: its default view is a palette of swatches. I'd suggest this should be the go-to approach most of the time (depending on your audience). The <a href="resource:JColorWell">JColorWell</a> is a component that offers both a palette and a dialog.

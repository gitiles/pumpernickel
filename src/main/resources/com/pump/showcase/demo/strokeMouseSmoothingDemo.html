<title>Stroke, MouseSmoothing Demo</title>
</head>
<body>

This demonstrates a few different classes:
<ul>
<li>The <code>MouseSmoothing</code> interface models a class that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothing">smooths out</a> incoming mouse data:
<br>
<blockquote><pre>public interface MouseSmoothing {
  public void add(float x,float y,long t);
  public void reset();
  public GeneralPath getShape();
  public void getShape(GeneralPath path);
  public boolean isEmpty();
}</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The smoothing toggle in this demo uses the <code>BasicMouseSmoothing</code> class to smooth out your drawings, or (when disabled) it renders the points exactly as the MouseEvents capture them.
<li>The <code>BristleStroke</code> splatters tiny shapes (like shrapnel) over your path. The frequency of the shapes is a little greater in the middle of the stroke, and it tapers off towards the edges &#8208; depending on the thickness you've designated.
<li>The <code>BrushStroke</code> uses a <code>MeasuredShape</code> to break up the original path into small sections and paint them in streaks.
<li>The <code>CalligraphyStroke</code> emulates a fixed-angle nib tracing a shape.
<li>The <code>CharcoalStroke</code> starts with another Stroke (by default a BasicStroke) and inserts cracks at a fixed angle into that shape.
</ul>

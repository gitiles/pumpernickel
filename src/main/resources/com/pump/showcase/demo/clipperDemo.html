How do you clip a shape to a Rectangle? The canonical Java approach is:
<p>
<pre>Area area = new Area(myArbitraryShape);
Rectangle2D rect = new Rectangle2D.Float(x,y,w,h);
area.intersect(new Area(rect));</pre>
<p>
There's just one problem: if your shape is not linear, the <code>java.awt.geom.Area</code> class is a horrible, rotten no-good class to resort to.
<p>
I wasn't aware of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland-Hodgman_clipping_algorithm">Sutherland-Hodgman clipping algorithm</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weiler-Atherton_clipping_algorithm">Weiler-Atherton clipping algorithm</a> when I set out to tackle this problem, and I ended up creating a different model that doesn't necessarily match either of those. (Does that mean I created the "Wood Clipping Algorithm"? Ugh. That sounds terrible. Makes me think of wood chipping.)
<p>
In my new <code>Clipper</code> class, the <code>PathIterator</code> from the source shape is traced exactly once. As it is traced it is constrained by the clipping shape. If a curve/segment lies outside the clipping rectangle (or intersects it), then it is flattened against the rectangle. For example:
<br />
<img src="https://github.com/mickleness/pumpernickel/raw/master/resources/clipping.gif" /> &nbsp; <img src="https://github.com/mickleness/pumpernickel/raw/master/resources/clipping2.gif" />
<br />
This can lead to redundant lines with no depth, but this data is passed through another filter that collapses redundant points outside the clipping bounds.

<h3>Results</h3>

As of this writing when I run this locally my results resemble:

I was surprised to see the <code>Clipper</code> for cubic shapes outperformed the <code>Area</code> for linear shapes. That suggests even if you're only dealing with polygons: the <code>Clipper</code> class is still worth considering.
<p>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>
What exactly do those numbers mean? For each data sample we measure the time/memory required to clip 100 shapes with 20 random segments. Each shape fits within a 300x300 rectangle, and we're clipping it to a centered 100x100 rectangle. We run each test 10 times and only keep the median time/memory measurement.
<p>
As the number of path segments increases, the cost of the <code>Area</code> class does not scale linearly. (And when I reached 35 segments: I started getting OutOfMemoryErrors.) But 20 random segments is a <em>lot</em> of complex data. Most shapes (such as glyphs in a font) do not self-intersect nearly as often as random shapes, so we might see less terrible numbers if we used more predictable shapes.

In Swing all user and UI activity from mouse clicks to repaints is handled on the event dispatch thread. What happens when that thread is locked?
<p>
The simple answer is: your session is toast. Your user is screwed. After a few seconds of unresponsiveness (maybe 5?) they'll probably kill the application. Or if they wait long enough: the OS may helpfully <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/6f7fqc/windows_being_windows/">prompt them to kill it</a>.
<p>
If we embrace the tragic idea that our app will have bugs and may occasionally reach a deadlock, then we can start talking about contingency plans. The <code>AWTMonitor</code> class sets up a separate thread and regularly pings the event dispatch thread to see if it's responsive. When that ping isn't acknowledged: it can notify listeners about the problem.
<p>
What can you do at this point? My top recommendations might be:
<ul><li>Auto-save any user information/documents in a safe place that can be retrieved on the next launch.
<li>Launch a separate process to help the user kill the original process and recover.
<li>Print all the current thread stacktraces to the console and relay that information to the developer. If you can't automatically upload that to a server, then save it in a text file and help users email it to you if they initiate a help desk ticket.
<li>Call <code>Thread.stop()</code> on the event dispatch thread.</ul>
<p>
That last suggestion is terrible. You shouldn't do it. There's lots of commentary <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16504140/thread-stop-deprecated">regarding why</a>. That being said: if your options are do nothing (so the user is definitely in trouble) or terminate the EDT (so the user may-or-may-not be able to continue to use your app), then terminating the EDT is something I'd personally consider.
<p>
(Of course you'll want to consider what an appropriate ping delay is for your software. As a rule of thumb I'd recommend 2-5 seconds, but depending on your users/use cases you may choose something different...)
<p>
This demo features the last two suggestions: print all stacktraces to the console, and call <code>Thread.stop()</code> on the event dispatch thread. (As of this writing the latter works and my session is recovered -- but that may change over time. To repeat: it's a terrible, terrible idea. You should only consider it as a last resort!)
<p>
Dealing with deadlocks was the original motivation behind the <code>AWTMonitor</code>, but there is an unintended benefit it can offer: if you collect logs from your users it can also identify points where the UI appears unresponsive but recovers. So if you have a JTree with 10,000 rows or if a thumbnail takes too long to render: you can get a snapshot of what all your threads were doing when the user would perceive the application as frozen. This exposes an area you can refactor to improve the user's experience.

The <code>com.pump.icon.Win32ShellIcon</code> class uses reflection to access icons from the <code>sun.awt.shell.Win32ShellFolder2</code> class. You should only rely on this class if you control the JDK you ship/launch with, or if you're careful to structure your invocation in try/catch blocks.
<p>
After I wrote the <code>AquaIcon</code> class I wanted to explore whether there was a similar mechanism for Windows. Unfortunately the closest I could find is what's in this demo. These icons look about two decades old, so it's also no surprise that they come in two flavors: "regular" (16 pixels) and "large" (32 pixels).
<p>
I can't promise I will never use these, but the results are disappointing.

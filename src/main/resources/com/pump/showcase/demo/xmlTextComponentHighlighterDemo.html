<p>
This demo features three classes:
<ul><li>The <code>com.pump.swing.XMLTextComponentHighlighter</code> interacts with the Swing text component to apply special formatting to render XML text.<br/><br/>
<li>The <code>com.pump.io.xml.XMLParser</code> breaks up text into XML-based tokens. This class is incomplete. It can parse what I call "everyday XML", like what's in this demo. But if you actually study the XML specification: there's a lot of complex witchcraft to support to be a full-fledged XML parser. This meets my needs for now; I'll see if I ever have to scale this up or find another parser. (I did experiment with a couple of existing parsers, but I found they didn't give me the exact positions of each token. If anyone has any leads for an XML parser that I should try, please let me know!)<br/><br/>
<li>And the faithful <code>com.pump.swing.LineNumberBorder</code> renders the line number to the left of each line.</ul>

The <code>com.pump.swing.JEyeDropper</code> is a dialog that lets the user choose a pixel color from anywhere on the screen.

<h3>Keyboard Support</h3>

This includes the following keyboard events:
<ol><li>Return/enter/space selects the current pixel.</li>
<li>Escape cancels the operation.</li>
<li>Left/right/up/down nudges the mouse location.</li>
<li>Plus/minus zooms in/out.</li></ol>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

This is implemented as a modal circular JDialog that follows the mouse. It uses the <code>java.awt.Robot</code> class both to capture pixel data and to move the mouse.

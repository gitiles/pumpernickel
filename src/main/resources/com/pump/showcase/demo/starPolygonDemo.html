<body>
The <code>com.pump.geom.StarPolygon</code> is a simple implementation of a star with variable end points and two radii. The first radius always points directly up, so every star is horizontally symmetrical.
<p>
You can specify the radii and the center point, but you can't directly set its bounds.
<p>
There is a special constructor to create a traditional 5-point star.

<title>DecoratedListUI, DecoratedTreeUI Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
A decoration is a UI component overlayed inside or on top of another component. Muted-color simple buttons/decorations are very common modern UIs. This is great way to add extra functionality for power users without adding too much visual clutter.
<p>
This demo shows a <code>JList</code> and a <code>JTree</code> that support several decorations. The decorations are only visible for the selected row, although this is customizable. For example: if you click the refresh decoration the throbber that follows is permanently visible until all other cells are reinserted. I found making all decorations permanently visible leads to a lot of visual clutter, so my preferences is to only show them for selected/indicated rows.
<p>
The decorations, like cell renderers themselves, are not components that live in the official tree hierarchy. They are painted (like a stamp) as needed. Because they aren't part of the window hierarchy: they won't interface with AccessibleContexts. That means this is a handy way to build a feature-rich UI, but using decorations shouldn't be the <em>only</em> way users can access any given feature. Always include a menu item (or contextual menu item), or some other way to invoke these features.
<p>
The decorations in this demo are some of the more compelling examples I could brainstorm of how you might want to use this feature. But the <a href="resource:audioplayer">AudioPlayer</a> demo includes a completely different approach to a list decoration: a centered play/pause button and a circular progress indicator.

<body>
This demo shows how different AlphaComposites render.
<p>
It's one thing to read the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/AlphaComposite.html">AlphaComposite javadoc</a> to understand mathematically what each composite does, but sometimes its easier just to render it to help visualize the difference between SRC_ATOP and DST_OVER.
<p>
This demo does not feature any custom code from the Pumpernickel codebase. It's just here to help visualize what the <code>AlphaComposite</code> does on its own.

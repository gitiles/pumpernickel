<title>JButton, QButtonUI Demo</title>
</head>
<body>

This demo features JButton configuration options and new QButtonUI implementations.

<h3>JButton Configuration</h3>

If I want to make a traditional thumbnail button (with the text below the icon): how do I configure that button? This only comes up once every 2-3 years, which is just often enough for me to forget every time.
<p>
This demo lets me walk through how the key attributes JButtons alter its appearance so I can more easily identify which properties I need to change.

<h3>Aqua Implementation</h3>

If you're viewing this on Mac: the default ButtonUI is the AquaButtonUI. This demo shows off 3 special features of the AquaButtonUI:
<ol><li>Button Type: Apple offers a few specific button types to choose from. There <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2007/tn2196.html#BUTTONS">used to be</a> more, and they used to have specific roles/usages. But now Apple has simpler guidelines, and for the most part they encourage you to just the default <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/buttons/push-buttons/">push button</a>.
<li>Segment Position: If a button type supports segmented positions: then the demo includes three consecutive buttons "Left", "Middle", "Right". Segmented buttons are still often used in toolbars in Mac applications.
<li>Size Variant: these help shrink buttons ("regular", "small", "mini"). I don't have any examples handy that demonstrate that Apple still encourages using this practice, though.</ol>

<h3>QButtonUI</h3>

This demo also includes five new UIs: BevelButtonUI, GradientButtonUI, RecessedButtonUI, RoundRectButtonUI, SquareButtonUI. These are all subclasses of the abstract QButtonUI class.
<p>
QButtonUI subclasses include the following options:
<ol><li>Segment Positions: these are similar to Apple's implementation. QButtonUIs also include vertical segment positions, although this is not included in the demo. (Because, really, who needs vertically segmented buttons?)</li>
<li>Paint Stroke: these buttons are mostly rendered using a call to <code>Graphics2D.fill(shape)</code> and a separate call to <code>Graphics2D.draw(shape)</code>. This client property toggles off the <code>Graphics2D.draw(..)</code> instruction. (The <code>AbstractButton.isContentAreaFilled()</code> method is used to toggle the <code>Graphics2D.fill(..)</code> instruction.)
<li>Paint Focus: focus can be painted outside the button shape or inside the button shape. (And <code>AbstractButton.setFocusPainted(..)</code> toggles the presence of a painted focus entirely.)
<li>Buttons can also be rendered as a circle. This option is intended to only be used for buttons with an icon and no text. For example: a help button or a play/pause button.
<li>QButtonUIs can be converted to QComboBoxUIs so your JComboBoxes can match your JButtons in appearance. QComboBoxes include Apple's concept of being a "Pop-Up" button vs being a "Pull-Down" button.
</ol>
<p>
There is no "size variant" option, but you can manually change the corner radius size and font size of buttons tweak the size.
<p>
QButtonUIs are vector-based, so if you change their size manually they will adapt reasonably well.

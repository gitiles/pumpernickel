 * An interface for operations that can be cancelled.
 * <P>
 * This is useful when two different threads are involved in an operation:
 * Thread A wants to monitor an operation and Thread B is actually performing
 * it. If the user indicates they want to cancel the operation then Thread A
 * calls <code>cancel()</code>. Thread B should be checking the value of
 * <code>isCanceled()</code> regularly, and abort if it returns
 * <code>true</code> (maybe by throwing a <code>UserCanceledException</code>).
 * <P>
 * That is the primary use of this class. In some cases the opposite is also
 * useful: when Thread B completes an operation it should call
 * <code>finish()</code>, and Thread A can relay this status by regularly
 * checking <code>isFinished()</code>.
